Mini Assignment 1 
The story I created is based on Henry VIII, and it highlights relevant aspects and important events that took place during his reign. The story focuses on important years, and it starts with his coronation. This is a linear narrative that presents the events of the story in order. This type of story is informative, as it explains in detail what happened. I divided the story into 7 different areas of interest, and each area or category has further information about Henry VIII. This assignment was designed to learn about Tudor History, and how to incorporate the learnings into the different websites and browsers learned in class. The target audience for the story would be students learning history, and anyone interested in learning more about Tudor History. The main findings of the story came from relevant sources such as scholarly articles, historical websites, and important news articles. The story also contains visuals such as pictures, to engage the reader.
